If you're already using npm and a module bundler such as webpack or Rollup, you can run the following command to install the latest SDK (Learn more):

npm install firebase
Then, initialize Firebase and begin using the SDKs for the products you'd like to use.

// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyAOihzky1cAECHqvjT0XlPl9jYoj41jahU",
  authDomain: "crud3firebase.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "crud3firebase",
  storageBucket: "crud3firebase.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "39348629620",
  appId: "1:39348629620:web:6fb7ba622f9f559e6ee121"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
Note: This option uses the modular JavaScript SDK, which provides reduced SDK size.
